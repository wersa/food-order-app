# Food Order Cart
Practice project from Udemy course.

I built this project before watching the Udemy tutorial and then changed a few things after watching it. So the implementation is different from what was shown in the tutorial.


Tutorial code: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/11-practice-food-order-app


## Concepts applied
- hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect, useReducer)
- useContext
- custom hooks
- Portals
