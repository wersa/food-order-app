# food-order-app
Practice project from Udemy course.

I built this project before watching the Udemy tutorial and then changed a few things after watching it. So the implementation is slightly different from what was shown in the tutorial.

Code from the tutorial: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/11-practice-food-order-app

## Concepts applied
- basic hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect)
- useContext
- portals

## To-do
- [ ] Fix background of overlay
- [ ] Add form validation
